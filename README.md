## Usage (not stable)

1. Clone the repository
2. Create a folder named `content` in the root directory
3. Create a file named `index.md` in the `content` folder
4. Add the following content to the `index.md` file:

```
# Title of the website
```
5. Create a file named `footer.md` in the `content` folder
6. Add the following content to the `footer.md` file:

```
# Created by [Your Name](Your Website) | [Source Code](Your GitHub Repository)
```
7. Create a folder for each example in the `content` folder
